# Notes-app
💻 - Developed to practice React
❓ - It takes the users input and displays as a special note. On every note the user has a limit 100 characters and a progress bar that tracks how many 
characters the user has left. The user has an option to delete his note. The delete option was made, using the uuid library, which generates a new id for each note.
